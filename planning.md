create a main tag to hold all of the content(position:relative)
going mobile first.
the nav links element will pe positioned absolute and it will be hidden till the Hamburger menu is clicked.It will contain an x button which will close it.It's height will be 100vh {display flex:direction:column}.When turning back to desktop it's position will be static and it will be part of the nav.
The cart elemnt will be contained within a container element positioned relative,so that e can add the small count bubble which will pe positioned absolute.
Initially the cart will be empty.The only content it will have is a span saying the cart is empty.It will be positioned apsolute in relation to the nav element.
on desktop,in the product section we will have smaller images to hel choose the picture of the product we want to see.However on mobile those will not be available.There we will have o toggle by left and right buttons we create(they won't be available on desktop)
On desktop we will have to create a seperate section to display images which will be hidden,which will appear when we click on one of the smaller images.The default image shown will be the first picture clicked
